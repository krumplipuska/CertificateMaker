This is a side project of a side project.

I wanted to have a document editor which have some dynamic elements in it. 

I think excel is quite good.You can do formulas, and quick calculations. And you have even more customization options with VBA. However it is not quite a document editor what I wanted.
I also really like Canva because it is super easy to use. And it is have a beautiful UI. But unfortunately you cant make dynamic docs in it.

So i wanted to create something between the two...(Because no one like your Word...  .!.. )

I started to code with Cursor. Without ever checking the code itself.
Iam assuming that the code is a mess, but at this pont iam to afraid to check it. 

So I will continue developing with the same stupid mentality. 

Iam pretty sure that this will not cause any problem in the future.
